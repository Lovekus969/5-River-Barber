.............. what we have done so far and what we are going to do in short
 Overview:
As part of scaling the 5 River Barber platform, this project extends beyond the marketing website and introduces a fully functional software layer to manage appointments, prevent double bookings, and give exclusive access to the owner for managing internal business operations.



1 . Key Goals & Features:
 Dual Location Handling
Business operates from two locations (Location A and Location B), And Clients can select which location they want to book an appointment at.

2. Smart Appointment System
Users can:

Choose a date/time

Select location

Enter contact info and payment method (e.g. Cash on Arrival)

Logic check ensures:------------------------- MAin Concept Goes here kush just fix it .

üîí No double booking allowed at the same location and same time

‚úîÔ∏è Bookings can occur at the same time but at different locations

 3. Owner-Only Admin Dashboard
A secure /admin panel accessible only to the owner.

Features:

View all bookings

See client messages

Mark bookings as "Done"

Optionally cancel or reschedule appointments

4. Alert System for New Appointments
When a new appointment is booked, the owner dashboard shows:

A popup alert (using JavaScript alert() or modal)

All user details: name, time, location, and payment type

5. Separation of Public & Private Views
Public can only:

View services, about, gallery

Book appointments

Owner gets:

Hidden dashboard protected by login

No sensitive data exposed in public HTML or frontend JS
