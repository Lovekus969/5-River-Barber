5 Rivers Barbershop Website & Management System — Progress Update
What’s Working Well So Far
The core features are solid — appointments, services, gallery, and owner control.

The UI feels modern with a clean, responsive design that works on mobile and desktop.

Owner panel now has a secure passcode prompt (@1313) with JS validation and obfuscation to hide the logic.

Booking page, service pages, and gallery are coming together nicely.

Integrated Google Maps for both locations in the footer.

Polished the calculator with better contrast and blur effects — easy to read now.

Fixed bugs related to password redirect, “View More” button conflicts, and navbar visibility on smaller screens.

JavaScript redundancy reduced by moving repeated scripts into a single external file (confuser.js obfuscated).

Classic haircut page done; beard trim page next.

Footer updated on multiple pages, working on cleaning up IDs and CSS inconsistencies.

Issues / What Needs Fixing
Background image on some pages isn’t landing well — owner wants it changed for better vibe.

Gallery images don’t scale well on iPhone 14 Pro Max — user experience suffers, need to fix sizing.

Password currently visible in DevTools if someone inspects source — frontend only, not secure enough yet. Planning backend login next.

Footer text size (like shop timings) is too big; needs to be smaller and consistent.

“Back to Home” button has an arrow that looks off; will remove it for cleaner UI.

Owner manual page needs structural improvements and polish.

Navbar disappears on smaller screen widths on booking page — responsive bug to fix.

Some pages use old footer markup with IDs causing redirection errors; standardizing all footers now.

Owner panel header color mismatches site palette, affects UX — plan to update colors soon.

Payment method in booking form is incomplete; appointment validation (double booking prevention) still pending.

Final testing on Netlify/Vercel to confirm live deployment matches local perfectly.

Next Steps
Replace problematic background image with something fresh and aligned with brand vibe.

Fix gallery image responsiveness specifically for high-res mobile devices.

Remove inline CSS, clean up old stylesheets, and polish existing pages.

Build remaining service pages: Beard trim, Kids/Teen styles, Royal combo, etc.

Complete owner dashboard features: search bookings, filter by location, mark complete.

Add appointment validation logic to avoid double bookings and manage slots better.

Develop admin login with backend support (Node.js + Express + MongoDB planned).

Add email/SMS notifications for new appointments.

Continue UI improvements: animations, smooth scroll, mobile-first refinements.

Update favicon and unify branding across all pages.

Motivation & Philosophy
I’m not stopping until I hit 555 contributions on this project.
Every bug fixed, every feature added is a step closer to something great.
This isn’t just a website — it’s my grind, my dream in motion.
Real dev work is messy and imperfect — but persistence wins.
I build better every day, learning from every mistake.

    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  }
})();
