one more owner page missing  the fav icon 
Lets secure it using hash pass word or someing lets searcch and do it 
and i will deploy it by the end of this month . 
Mistakes are getting biggger and bigger . 
One major mistake 
(function checkPassword() {
  const correctPassword = '@1313';
  let enteredPassword = prompt("Enter owner password:");
  if (enteredPassword !== correctPassword) {
    alert("Incorrect password. Redirecting...");
    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  }
})();
 Problem
Anyone can see the password in View Source or DevTools.

It's just plain text in the frontend ‚Äî not secure.

üí¨ Owner Panel Logic

(function checkPassword() {
  const correctPassword = '@1313';
  let entered = prompt("Enter Owner Password:");

  if (entered !== correctPassword) {
    alert("Wrong password! Redirecting...");
    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  }
})();
üîê Owner Panel is hidden until the correct passcode is entered.

üöÄ Motivation
I will not stop until I grind to 555 contributions.
Every feature, every fix, every commit is one step closer to success.
This isn‚Äôt just a website ‚Äî it‚Äôs a dream in motion.

üí° Future Goals
üåê Move to dynamic backend (Express + MongoDB)

üìß Add admin email/SMS alerts for new bookings

üîë Add full login system (username + password + role)

üì± Fully mobile-first and PWA-capable redesign

üß† Lesson Learned
Failure is part of the journey.

Real dev work isn‚Äôt always perfect, but momentum wins.

No one builds alone ‚Äî the code is my daily reflection. Build better every day.
