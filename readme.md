💬 Owner Panel Logic

(function checkPassword() {
  const correctPassword = '@1313';
  let entered = prompt("Enter Owner Password:");

  if (entered !== correctPassword) {
    alert("Wrong password! Redirecting...");
    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  }
})();
🔐 Owner Panel is hidden until the correct passcode is entered.

🚀 Motivation
I will not stop until I grind to 555 contributions.
Every feature, every fix, every commit is one step closer to success.
This isn’t just a website — it’s a dream in motion.

💡 Future Goals
🌐 Move to dynamic backend (Express + MongoDB)

📧 Add admin email/SMS alerts for new bookings

🔑 Add full login system (username + password + role)

📱 Fully mobile-first and PWA-capable redesign

🧠 Lesson Learned
Failure is part of the journey.

Real dev work isn’t always perfect, but momentum wins.

No one builds alone — the code is my daily reflection. Build better every day.
